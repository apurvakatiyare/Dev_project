🔧 Technologies Used

🗂 Git & GitHub – Version control and repository management

🤖 Jenkins – Automation server for CI/CD

🛡 SonarQube – Code quality and security analysis

🐳 Docker – Containerization for deployment

🖥 Linux (Debian) – Operating system for hosting and automation


🎯 Objectives

✅ Automate the build, test, and deployment process.

🔍 Ensure code quality and security compliance using SonarQube.

📦 Containerize the application using Docker.

🔄 Achieve continuous integration and continuous deployment using Jenkins.


🔄 Workflow

📝 Code Commit: Developer pushes code to GitHub.

🚀 Jenkins Trigger: Jenkins detects changes in the repository and triggers a build.

🔍 Code Analysis: SonarQube analyzes the code for quality and security vulnerabilities.

🏗 Docker Build: The application is containerized using Docker.

📤 Docker Hub Push: The container image is pushed to Docker Hub.

🌐 Deployment: The containerized application is deployed to a server.
